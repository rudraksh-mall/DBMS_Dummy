## Seeded content

- **8 wards** across Lucknow, Prayagraj and Gorakhpur (real polygon boundaries).
- **10 complaints** spanning every status (`submitted`, `acknowledged`,
  `in_progress`, `resolved`) and all four priority tiers.
- **19 upvotes** and a full **complaint_status_history** trail.

The seed is idempotent — re-running `npm run seed` never duplicates these rows.
